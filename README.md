A 2D platformer game made in Unity. 

PlayerController.cs - This script handles input and player character movement, behavior, collision detection, and sprite appearance and animation. The isGrounded value, determined by a groundCheck object, is used to allow the player to jump only if the value is true. The player cannot jump while already in the air (although a double jump feature may be added, which would allow the player to jump one time in the air.)
